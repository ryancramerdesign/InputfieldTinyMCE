This module was previously in the ProcessWire core, but has been removed
as of ProcessWire 2.4.9. But this module will continue to be maintained
and updated as needed as a 3rd party module. If you require TinyMCE in 
your ProcessWire installation or have spent time configuring it for your
site and would rather not change to CKEditor, you should install this. 

To install, place in /site/modules/InputfieldTinyMCE/. If your site
is already using TinyMCE and you just upgraded to a version of PW that 
no longer has it, you shouldn't need to do anything other than go to 
Admin > Modules > Check for new modules. PW should automatically pick
up on the new location and start using it immediately with your
existing fields already configured for TinyMCE
