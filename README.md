# TinyMCE rich text editor for ProcessWire

This module was previously in the ProcessWire core, but has been removed
as of ProcessWire 2.4.9. 

If you are running a version of ProcessWire before 2.4.9, this module
will be of no use to you, since it is already present in the core. 

This module will continue to be maintained and updated as needed as a 3rd 
party module. If you require TinyMCE in your ProcessWire installation or 
have spent time configuring it for your site and would rather not change 
to CKEditor, you should install this. 

## Installation

To install, place in `/site/modules/InputfieldTinyMCE/`. If your site
is already using TinyMCE and you just upgraded to a version of PW that 
no longer has it, you shouldn't need to do anything other than go to 
Admin > Modules > Check for new modules. PW should automatically pick
up on the new location and start using it immediately with your
existing fields already configured for TinyMCE
